# Speeding up test execution times
When it comes to accelerating test execution times to improve RTO times, you have to consider parallelization.
In its most extreme form this will reduce the total test execution time to the runtime of the longest test.

## Parallelization in python
For python projects, when using pytest, there are not that many options to parallelize tests.
 
Pytest-xdist stands out as a valuable plugin.
Designed to parallelize tests, this pytest plugin offers a promising solution for speeding up the testing process.
However, while pytest-xdist effectively distributes tests across multiple workers, there are certain intricacies that users need to be aware of to unlock its full potential.

Although pytest-xdist successfully achieves parallelization, it does introduce some overhead:
- Spinning up workers
- Collecting and distributing tests to the workers.
- Bundling the test results

## X-dist configuration
Depending on the amount of tests and the typical runtime it might even be advantageous to not use it at all.
Part of the challenge lies in the default parameters of the plugin, which might not be well-suited for every scenario.

Careful monitoring is essential.
By default the xdist scheduler assigns multiple collections of tests consisting of multiple tests (test chunks) to a worker.
As lengthy tests can be unintentionally assigned to the same worker, leading to suboptimal execution times.
For example, in the scenario where there are 98 fast tests (<1 second) and two slow tests (1 minute), it is possible that in a test chunk, these
slow tests are assigned to the same worker leading to a run of 2 minutes or more, while if scheduled "correctly" it would have been a test run of 1 minute.

# In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
In the realm of software orchestration for optimizing test execution time, a common challenge surfaces—the delicate balance between enhancing efficiency and the potential drawbacks of maintenance and team diversion. 
However, amidst this landscape, a notable exception arises. 
Tinybird's innovative approach to [test orchestration](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/better-ci-pipeline-with-data#problem-1--inefficient-utilization-of-test-workers) has managed to achieve impressive gains in test time optimization.
From a technical standpoint, their solution is certainly commendable, showcasing effective utilization of resources.
Yet, it leaves me pondering why a more user-friendly intermediate solution—one that doesn't necessitate the integration of a SQL database—is not readily configured for seamless out-of-the-box implementation.
This question prompts exploration into the broader landscape of software orchestration, urging us to question the boundaries of default configurations and their alignment with practical needs.
In this context, pytest-xdist frequently emerges as one of the limited well-maintained libraries providing a viable remedy.

# Conclusion
As developers, we're confronted with the reality that even though Python boasts an extensive ecosystem of libraries, the domain of efficient test parallelization might still be relatively underrepresented. 
While pytest-xdist undeniably brings us a step closer to achieving faster test runs, it also encourages us to seek and potentially contribute to more versatile solutions in the Python landscape. 
As we continue to grapple with the challenges of maximizing the efficiency of our testing processes, exploring the available options and advocating for enhancements remains pivotal in our pursuit of reliable and accelerated software development.
